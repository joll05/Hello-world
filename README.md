# Hello-world
I'm trying to get as many "Hello World!" programs in different languages as I can into one repo. Currently I have:
+ Python

I'm planning on eventually creating executables for everything so that you don't have to compile them. In the meantime you can just paste the code into a website like [tio.run](https://tio.run) to test it.
